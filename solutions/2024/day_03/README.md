# Day 3 (2024)

`TITLE` ([prompt](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3))


## Things I've learned (or re-learned)

* the `re` methods do not cause . to match a newline in multiline input without `re.DOTALL`.
* `pipe` has a `chain` function (I struggled to find it at first).
* piping to `Pipe(sum)` (for example) shouldn't really work, but for some reason advent prints the single int
